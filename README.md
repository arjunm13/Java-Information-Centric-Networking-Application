# Java-Information-Centric-Networking-Application
Designed and developed router discovery and packet forwarding protocols using Java Socket programming API, Used UDP sockets for Neighbor discovery and information queries Multiple computers were able to connect/disconnect and whilst maintaining a fully connected network

The virtual election booth application being discussed in this report was implemented using
Java and makes use of Java cryptographic class libraryâ€™s RSA and DES algorithm classes. RSA
and DES are cryptographic systems used for encrypting and decrypting. RSA generates
asymmetric public-private keys that consist of large integers. A block of data can be encrypted by
using either the RSA public or private key and decrypted using the correlated key, if the public
key is used to encrypt the data, the private key will be used to decrypt the data and vice-versa. The
generated public and private keys need to be distrusted to the senders and receivers of the data.
Generally, systems that require users to verify that the data being sent is authentic keeps the the
private key to itself and distributed the public key to users. This is to ensure the data they are
receiving is indeed from the server
