# Java-Information-Centric-Networking-Application
Designed and developed router discovery and packet forwarding protocols using Java Socket programming API, Used UDP sockets for Neighbor discovery and information queries Multiple computers were able to connect/disconnect and whilst maintaining a fully connected network

An IP address based network is made between multiple routers that is connected together in a particular topology. The network will contain an information transport service in which a router can request a specific file from another router. This will then trigger a query flood from the sender of the request to all routers present in the network. The router which contains the desired file will then respond to the request and the network will then create a flow control scheme in which will make a path for the information to go from the sender to the receiver of the file. This design will demonstrate a simple flow control scheme to send information from one router to another.
